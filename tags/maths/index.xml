That means they have $2^{128}$ possible values which is roughly $3 \cdot 10^{38}$ (or in scientific notation, 3e38).

But is it at least collision-safe? I think definitely yes. And is it also guess-safe? Let&amp;rsquo;s explore that question with a bit of maths:</description></item></channel></rss>
