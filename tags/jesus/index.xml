>Tanakh&lt;/a>, I recently came across the book of Ruth.
I want to share some things from this book and its surroundings that really stood out to me afresh.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-surrounding-context-of-scripture">The Surrounding Context of Scripture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the Tanakh order of books, Ruth is directly preceded by the book of Proverbs.
The last chapter, Proverbs 31, talks about the &amp;ldquo;woman of noble character&amp;rdquo;.
And in Ruth 3, Boaz interestingly calls Ruth such an &amp;ldquo;woman of noble character&amp;rdquo; (he is using the exact same Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;noble&amp;rdquo; as in Proverbs 31).
This alone starts showing how it&amp;rsquo;s not about being an Israelite in the first place that gives you God&amp;rsquo;s recognition but &lt;strong>by placing your full trust in Him&lt;/strong>.
We will see in a moment how Ruth is an example of this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book directly after Ruth in the Tanakh order is the Song of Songs.
One of the main themes is how the woman and the man seek and chase each other.
Ruth in this story is not chasing any human lover however — she goes after God.
This sets the scene wonderfully to show how even the seemingly most earthly-romantic book in Scripture is not just about humans, it&amp;rsquo;s also about humans together with God:
&lt;strong>We as Jesus&amp;rsquo; bride are to seek Him and chase after Him in all that we do.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ruth-puts-her-trust-in-god">Ruth Puts Her Trust In God&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When Ruth and her sister-in-law Orpah rise to accompany their mother-in-law Naomi back to Israel, Naomi tells them to leave for a better future in their homecountry, Moab.
Orpah leaves but &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ruth1%3A16-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ruth proclaims her loyalty to Naomi&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you.
&lt;strong>Where you go&lt;/strong> I will go, and where you stay I will stay.
&lt;strong>Your people&lt;/strong> will be my people and &lt;strong>your God&lt;/strong> my God.
Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This alone does not make it look a lot like Ruth would put her trust mostly in God.
But a few verses later, Boaz nails it by speaking out what was deep in Ruth&amp;rsquo;s heart (2:12):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>May the Lord repay you for what you have done!
May you be richly rewared by the Lord, the God of Israel, &lt;strong>under whose wings you have come to take refuge&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s right:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ruth did not come to &lt;strong>take refuge under Naomi&amp;rsquo;s wings&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This embittered mother-in-law, blinded by her self-centered grief, unable to care for herself as a widow, was in no way a future prospect for Ruth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leaning unto this woman when you just lived through a tragic loss yourself was certainly not an easy task and one that &lt;em>you needed to rely on Someone Else&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ruth would not come to take refuge under the wings of the &lt;strong>people of Israel&lt;/strong> either:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Going to Israel and trying to live there she would certainly face &lt;em>ostracism and poverty&lt;/em> because she was a foreigner, and a widow at that!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I suspect that during the 10 years she was married to Mahlon, &lt;em>Ruth got to know the God of Israel intimately&lt;/em> when she experienced the life of a Jewish family through the course of each day, week, and year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clinging">Clinging&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We read that Orpah leaves Naomi, but Ruth &amp;ldquo;clings to her&amp;rdquo;.
The Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;clinging&amp;rdquo; here, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.csv-bibel.de/strongs/h1692" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dabaq&lt;/a>, is interesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s the same word used in Genesis 2 about how a man who will leave his parents and &amp;ldquo;cling to his wife&amp;rdquo; with the two becoming one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s also used for something that &amp;ldquo;sticks&amp;rdquo; to you like glue, just like stains on your hands or your tongue to the roof of your mouth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>not passive&lt;/strong>: The Philistine army &amp;ldquo;sticks to the heels&amp;rdquo; of the Israelites, and Ruth is also told to &amp;ldquo;stick to the maids&amp;rdquo; of Boaz.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This kind of &amp;ldquo;clinging&amp;rdquo; is the action of attaching yourself to someone and therefore being &lt;strong>very close&lt;/strong> to that person, up to &lt;em>intimacy&lt;/em>, and by being that close, &lt;strong>automatically following them&lt;/strong>.
For me, this is the kind of &amp;ldquo;glueing myself&amp;rdquo; to Jesus that I want to live more every day, just like David says in Psalm 63:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If we not only draw near to Him &lt;em>from time to time&lt;/em> but instead &lt;strong>live&lt;/strong> with Him and stick to His heels, obedience to His words and conformance to His loving character will follow as a natural fruit, just like we read in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/2%20Corinthians3%3A18" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>2 Corinthians 3:18&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We all, as we contemplate the Lord&amp;rsquo;s glory with unveiled faces, are being transformed into His image with ever-increasing glory.
This transformation comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="the-shortsightedness-of-all-the-others">The Shortsightedness Of All The Others&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Elimelech only saw a famine and tried to secure physical survival for his family by moving to Moab — tragically, he and his sons died in spite of his best intentions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Naomi only sees her loss — although she later recognizes and praises God&amp;rsquo;s hand moving in favor of her and Ruth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nameless &amp;ldquo;closer redeemer&amp;rdquo; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/Ruth4%3A6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>only sees his own possession&lt;/a> and tries to secure his family&amp;rsquo;s inheritance and prosperity by relying on his riches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>But Ruth and Boaz see something far greater.&lt;/strong>
Their eyes are on God first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ruth seems to have no problem in trusting God to completely take care of her in a foreign country with (from a human perspective) the outlook of a dim, impoverished existence at the margins of society.
She does not feverishly spring into action nor does she just sit back and do nothing.
Out of her trust in God, she faithfully gathers grain for her mother-in-law and herself throughout every working day, all day long, all the months of the harvest.
And it&amp;rsquo;s only when &lt;em>Naomi&lt;/em> suggests Ruth approach Boaz about the redeemer thing that she does it instead of doing it on her own account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boaz does not venture on frantically either:
He understood all along that God was moving here and that he could fully trust Him to bring everything together at the right time.
When Ruth asks him to redeem them, he is not even afraid of the &amp;ldquo;closer redeemer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They both see God is at work in everything:
In the famine, in the deaths of Ruth&amp;rsquo;s husband and other family men, in the whole harvest season, in the redemption story — and even beyond what they are going to see with their own eyes!
They see God at work and &lt;strong>willingly intertwine their actions with God&amp;rsquo;s movements&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Boaz does not even &amp;ldquo;endanger his family inheritance&amp;rdquo; like the &amp;ldquo;closer redeemer&amp;rdquo; feared.
He gets something far, far better:
A place in the family line of King David and ultimately Jesus, the Son of Man and Son of God.
Now that is a family inheritance!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Job and Truth in the Innermost</title><link>https://jscheytt.github.io/p/job-and-truth-in-the-innermost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 20:27:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jscheytt.github.io/p/job-and-truth-in-the-innermost/</guid><description>&lt;p>About 2 years ago I decided to start reading the Old Testament in the reading order of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tanakh&lt;/a>, the Hebrew bible.
Recently, I came across the book of Job.
This was one among the many books in the Bible I found hard to read or make sense of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as part of my journey into &lt;a class="link" href="https://jscheytt.github.io/p/rediscovering-our-hidden-life-in-god/" >rediscovering the abundant yet hidden life in Him&lt;/a> even all the seemingly strange books of the Old Testament start lighting up.
Let&amp;rsquo;s keep in mind that Jesus, the Son of God, was announced by John as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/John1%3A14" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;the Word&amp;rdquo; Himself&lt;/a>.
What this encompasses for me is that whenever you read the Scriptures — fittingly called &lt;em>God&amp;rsquo;s Word&lt;/em> — you are &lt;strong>reading Jesus&lt;/strong>.
So when we read the Scriptures with the mindset of young Samuel in the temple, saying &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Samuel3%3A10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;Speak Lord, Your servant is listening,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> and staying on the lookout for Jesus we can surely expect to find Him anywhere in Scripture!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And thus, the book of Job started lighting up for me as a story about &lt;strong>how to treat one another in suffering&lt;/strong> according to Jesus&amp;rsquo; heart and the prayerful community of love (&lt;a class="link" href="https://jscheytt.github.io/p/rediscovering-our-hidden-life-in-god/" >see Chapter 7 of &amp;ldquo;The Divine Conspiracy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>).
It illustrates what a Kingdom way of treating each other in bad times looks like and shows how to truly love a friend who is suffering a great loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-the-three-friends-get-right">What The Three Friends Get Right&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When Job&amp;rsquo;s three friends hear about their friends great misfortune, they set out to find him, &lt;em>not leaving him alone&lt;/em>.
When they find him, they cry out in desperation.
They sit down with him and &lt;em>share his fate&lt;/em> — down in the dust, in the solitude, in the sickness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We read they even stay with him &lt;em>in silence&lt;/em> and fasting 7 days and nights.
They don&amp;rsquo;t start by saying anything, they start by &lt;em>making themselves one with Job&lt;/em> in his suffering, experiencing and feeling the same pain.
When the conversation starts, they don&amp;rsquo;t start giving wonderful advice on their own.
They &lt;em>let Job begin by sharing his heart&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-they-go-wrong">Where They Go Wrong&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>They are &lt;em>not truthful&lt;/em>.
Just like Job, neither of them effectively knows why the trouble and loss came.
But the three friends act as if they knew!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They try to justify God&amp;rsquo;s actions, &lt;em>speaking on His behalf&lt;/em> motivated by fear.
As if the Great One had any need for small humans hastily jumping to His defense!
Of course God loves it when we honor Him and live out a deep reverence towards Him.
But we cannot force others to do so.
And more importantly, doing anything in our lives &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Romans14%3A23" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>out of fear instead of trust is effectively sin&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They say tons of &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; things — but also out of fear, not out of faith:
Each of them in their own way proclaims God&amp;rsquo;s faithfulness and loyalty towards the ones who stick to Him.
One of them even prophecies that God will reward Job back with double what he lost — and &lt;em>at the end&lt;/em> of the story this is even 100 % fulfilled!
But their &lt;strong>hearts&lt;/strong> are not right:
They just try to stand on the right side of the argument instead of loving their friend by being honest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end of the story teaches us that you can say any amount of factually correct things that are legitimately right — but if your heart is not right, God will outright reject it!
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Job42%3A7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>In the final chapter of the book&lt;/a>, He even goes so far as saying:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, &lt;strong>as my servant Job has&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ponder this for a moment:
Job&amp;rsquo;s speeches are partially inconsistent, even contradictory about what God does or what God&amp;rsquo;s character is like.
But for God it is Job &lt;strong>in his truthfulness&lt;/strong> who speaks &lt;em>the truth&lt;/em> instead of his friends who emit &lt;em>true facts&lt;/em> &lt;strong>without truthfulness&lt;/strong>, not speaking from a place of vulnerable honesty.
This is what we also clearly see in Psalm 51 where David remarks that God &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Psalm51%3A6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;delights in truth in the inward being&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="its-about-where-god-is-speaking">It&amp;rsquo;s About Where God Is Speaking&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And then the fourth friend appears: Elihu.
He speaks from a point outside of the spectrum of Job and his friends.
He is not trying to position himself somewhere along the lines of &amp;ldquo;God is always just&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Job has never done any wrong&amp;rdquo;.
Instead He finds the &amp;ldquo;third way&amp;rdquo; beyond their perspective, which is ultimately a perspective of extreme distance to God:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He approaches Job &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Job33%3A6-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>in a resolute yet loving manner&lt;/a>.
He talks to both sides about their rights and wrongs.
And he emphasizes the point that this situation (and ultimately, all our lives) is not about who is right or wrong:
It&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/Job33%3A14" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>God speaking to us&lt;/a> through &lt;strong>all&lt;/strong> of life&amp;rsquo;s circumstances and events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see the same pattern in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/John9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>John 9&lt;/a> with Jesus and His disciples when they walk past a man who was born blind:
The disciples ask Jesus:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Who has done wrong that this man is suffering so much, his parents or he himself?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But then Jesus rightfully asks:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait a second — how did the idea enter your minds that this situation is about who sinned when and how?
All this trouble is a way for God to show His glory!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And then He goes ahead, heals him and we truly see how &amp;ldquo;the works of God are displayed in him&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see that Job&amp;rsquo;s loss, the blindness and poverty of the blindborn, and the messes which are our own lifes are all about God constantly speaking to us, wanting to reach His goal of deep connection with us.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Galatians2%3A19-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

How can we actually become good (and not only talk about being good)?
Is deep transformation of our characters on this side of eternity even possible?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was raised Charismatic/Pentecostal-Christian but the majority of my life often did not exhibit Christlikeness or actual trust in The One.
But in the last 3 years, there were two things that have deeply affected my live and changed my priorities and my heart:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Being in a small group in our church with a shared focus and goal of following Jesus and practicing His presence and His teachings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reading the book &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://dwillard.org/books/divine-conspiracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Divine Conspiracy&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; by Dallas Willard (and listening to sermons about topics of the book)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Much has been said about the striking outward similarity of the daily lives of professing Christians and non-Christians — and how we should actually expect to see something very different when we lead a life in accordance with God.
Sadly, none of this has ever helped me to a) identify the many areas in my life where I effectively did not place my reliance upon Jesus and b) learn to put my trust in Jesus.
What this book did for me — more than anything else — was to describe the beauty of God Himself, how well He has crafted this world in which we live, and what an extraordinary kind of life He has meant for us humans: a life in constant connectedness with Him, living out the life He would lead if He would live it here and now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From my experience, this book is capable of producing faith in Jesus by displaying Him as the all-competent Master of Life which He really is.
The core of the book (about two thirds) revolve around the Sermon on the Mount, the longest speech and the Master Lecture of Jesus.
These core teachings given by the Son of God never made sense to me in its entirety until I read the interpretations given by Dallas Willard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One word of caution:
The first 50 to 100 pages are not that easy to read.
On my first try at reading this book I stopped after about 50 pages because it felt too dry and it was not yet becoming clear what point Dallas Willard was trying to drive home.
But if you give him the benefit of the doubt you will get to the gold — that is, to discovering Jesus and the abundant life that He has and is for everyone who puts their complete trust in Him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One wonderful piece of news is that since a few months &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fontis-shop.de/products/gott-du-musst-es-selbst-erleben" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a translation in German has become available&lt;/a>.
That has made it even more accessible for me, even though I read and write a sizable portion of my working day in English!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Interpretation of Psalm 45</title><link>https://jscheytt.github.io/p/an-interpretation-of-psalm-45/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 18:04:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jscheytt.github.io/p/an-interpretation-of-psalm-45/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/Psalm45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Psalm 45&lt;/a> celebrates a royal wedding.
The first part addresses the groom and the second addresses (mostly) the bride.
I am focussing on this second part verses 10 through 17, and I interpret it in one of the ways I see very much fit:
With the groom being both God the Father and God the Son, and the church as His bride.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was recently starting to wonder about the size of the universe.
It&amp;rsquo;s not like I thought I could really get down to imagining this kind of gargantuan extent.
But I wanted to find a good analogy, so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine the distance furthest distance humans will soon travel: the &lt;strong>distance from Earth to Mars&lt;/strong>.
If you are lucky with planning, the shortest route takes almost an entire year (9 months) in a spaceship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s compare this distance to the &lt;strong>size of the observable universe&lt;/strong>.
The ratio between these two distances is in the order of &lt;strong>$10^{16}$&lt;/strong>.
That means there are 16 orders of magnitude in difference between these two lengths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What can we compare this to?
Let&amp;rsquo;s scale this down:
We will pretend our planet Earth is the universe.
Now imagine we wanted to drill a hole through the whole planet from one extreme to the other (e.g. from the North Pole to the South Pole).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we had started drilling the equivalent of the Earth-Mars distance, how far would we have gotten?
One meter?
A millimeter?
The width of a human hair?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out, we would have only gotten as far as the size of &lt;strong>one atom&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-we-even-imagine-this-at-all">Can we even imagine this at all?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For me this only starts to scratch the surface of trying to understand the sheer scale of the universe and the God behind it.
The problem with this analogy?
It still does not help a lot because I believe we humans cannot even really imagine the distance between Earth and Mars yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Earth we comfortably handle thousands, sometimes maybe tens of thousands of kilometers in our brains.
On our beautiful planet, this is the order of magnitude we are (gladly) confined to.
But the travel from Earth to Mars (i.e. the shortest path) is in the 10s of &lt;strong>millions&lt;/strong> of kilometers.
That is three orders of magnitude above what we normally deal with in daily life!
(If all the fuss around &amp;ldquo;orders of magnitude&amp;rdquo; sounds foreign to you, maybe the well-known video &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;Powers of Ten&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> can help you out.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will just state a hypothesis:
&lt;strong>I believe we humans cannot handle more than 12 orders of magnitude.&lt;/strong>
Everything beyond that will just not fit into our brains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In everyday life we normally handle about 10 orders of magnitude in space and time.
For space, that is e.g. from 10µm ($10^{-5}$ m) (about the width of a hair) to 10,000 km ($10^{5}$ m) (the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_km" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>distance between Barcelona and LA&lt;/a>).
For time, that is e.g. from 100 ms (a tenth of a second) to 100 years (about $10^{9}$ s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we stretch our imaginations we can go towards tens of thousands of kilometers (now we reach 12 orders of magnitude), and maybe we can begin to imagine 1,000 years and tens of milliseconds.
But I think beyond that we are just lost.
If any object is outside of these ranges we need to scale it up or down and compare it to things within this $10^{12}$ scale.
But if we try to compare things where their ratio is greater than $10^{12}$, our brains are just to tiny to fit these in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-big-is-the-universe-really">How big is the universe really?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we start to find words and numbers to describe the limits of our imagination, I think we start to really become capable of talking about how big the universe really is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The size of the universe is estimated at multiple tens of billions ($10^{10}$) of lightyears.
One lightyear is roughly $10^{16}$ m, so the size of our universe is in the ballpark of $10^{26}$.
On the other hand, the smallest length that currently fits into our model of the universe is the Planck length at about $10^{-35}$ m.
If we add the absolute values of the exponents, we get the so to speak &amp;ldquo;range of existence&amp;rdquo; of our universe:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
10^{(26+35)} = 10^{61}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That means our universe exists at about &lt;strong>60 orders of magnitude&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As per my above claim, none of us can even begin to imagine this number.
Just try it and keep in mind that 1 order of magnitude means &lt;em>multiply or divide by 10&lt;/em>.
In analogy, 3 orders of magnitude does not mean &lt;em>multiply or divide by 30&lt;/em> but &lt;em>multiply or divide by 1000&lt;/em>.
That means going from 10 orders of magnitude to 15 means &lt;strong>multiplying by 10,000&lt;/strong>.
You can start to see where this is going — but I bet none of us will ever by able to fully grasp such sizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above numbers are for space only, but (if I understand that correctly) time is analogous because we are basing it on the same measurements, on the same speed of light (for the upper bound), and the same &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Planck constant&lt;/a> (for the lower bound).
At the same time, we have to keep in mind that these 60 orders of magnitude come from limited measurements:
We were only able to discover them because of the finite speed of light and the current age of the universe, so it is likely that our universe is &lt;strong>even bigger&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our human imagination cannot even begin to nibble at these sizes.
I think our perception is even more logarithmic than linear, so we are already pretty well equipped to perceive and compare these orders of magnitude — our range is just ever so narrow.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-do-we-fit-into-all-this">How do we fit into all this?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have another number with me, a very simple one:
&lt;strong>5 percent&lt;/strong>.
Or, in other words, 0.05.
(Or $5\cdot10^{-2}$ if you like 😉.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a rough estimation on &lt;em>the amount of actual matter in the universe&lt;/em>.
When looking at the size and distribution of mass and energy in our universe, then typical baryonic matter makes up less than 5 percent of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Savor that slowly:
You and me, animals, atoms, the planets, the stars, even all the galaxies, all these account for &lt;strong>not even one twentieth&lt;/strong> of the universe!
And the rest of it is not even empty:
The universe is said to be filled by &lt;a class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dark Energy and Dark Matter&lt;/a>.
(If I could recoin them I would choose the names &lt;em>Invisible Matter&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Invisible Energy&lt;/em>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course this makes one feel very small as a human.
The crazy thing is:
The God who made all this (all matter visible and invisible), the loving Creator of The Heavens and The Earth, the one who is even bigger than 60 orders of magnitude, chose to reduce Himself &lt;em>drastically&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine this:
He created a universe full of wonderful stuff on which most humans will never even lay eyes on (and still they have a right to exist because He rejoices in them!), formed an inhabitable planet with healthy conditions for living, brought all kinds of nature and animals into existence — and then He started making humans &lt;strong>in His own likeness&lt;/strong>.
Hybrid beings, half dust, half Holy Breath, with their own will and therefore a capability to desire and &lt;strong>love Him back&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But He did not stop there:
Because He wanted to subvert all evil in this world with good, He wanted to show us His character and His way of living in the most direct way possible.
So He — became one of us.
The Uncreated and Eternal One laid aside all His privileges and folded up Himself, down to a miniscule body of atoms and molecules to live and breathe on this very planet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And not only that:
Although nobobdy even recognized Him (at least in public), He decided to let the verdict for all our betrayal against Him and one another fall upon Himself ✝️.
And in Him the eternal life that He joyfully lives together with His Father, became available to us — to everyone who puts their complete trust in the Son.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>So that is what you look at when you contemplate the universe:
The Perfect Father in all His overflowing beauty and richness and complexity — and at the same time His Son, Jesus, the One who made this loving God visible and touchable for us small humans ❤️.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
