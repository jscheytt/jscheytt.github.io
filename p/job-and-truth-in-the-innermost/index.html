Recently, I came across the book of Job.
This was one among the many books I found hard to read or make sense of in the Bible.</p><p>But as part of my journey into <a class=link href=/p/rediscovering-our-hidden-life-in-god/>rediscovering the abundant yet hidden life in Him</a> even all the seemingly strange books of the Old Testament start lighting up.
Let&rsquo;s keep in mind that Jesus, the Son of God, was announced by John as <a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/John1%3A14 target=_blank rel=noopener>&ldquo;the Word&rdquo; Himself</a>.
What this encompasses for me is that whenever you read the Scriptures — fittingly called <em>God&rsquo;s Word</em> — you are <strong>reading Jesus</strong>.
So when we read the Scriptures with the mindset of young Samuel in the temple, saying &ldquo;Speak Lord, Your servant is listening&rdquo;, and staying on the lookout for Jesus we surely can expect to find Him anywhere in Scripture!</p><p>And thus, the book of Job started lighting up for me as a story about <strong>how to treat one another in suffering</strong> according to Jesus&rsquo; heart and <a class=link href=/p/rediscovering-our-hidden-life-in-god/>the prayerful community of love</a>.
It illustrates what a Kingdom way of treating each other in bad times looks like and shows how to truly love a friend who is suffering a big loss.</p><h2 id=what-the-three-friends-got-right>What The Three Friends Got Right</h2><p>When they hear about their friend Job&rsquo;s great misfortune, they set out to find him, <em>not leaving him alone</em>.
When they find him, they cry out in desperation. They sit down with their friend and <em>share his fate</em> — down in the dust, in the solitude, in the sickness.</p><p>We read they even stay with him <em>in silence</em> and fasting 7 days and nights.
They don&rsquo;t start by speaking, they start by <em>making themselves one with Job</em> in his suffering, experiencing and feeling the same pain.
When the conversation starts, they don&rsquo;t start giving wonderful advice on their own.
They <em>let Job begin sharing his heart</em>.</p><h2 id=where-they-go-wrong>Where They Go Wrong</h2><p>They are <em>not truthful</em>.
Just like Job, neither of them effectively knows why the trouble and loss came.
But the three friends act as if they knew!</p><p>They try to justify God&rsquo;s actions, <em>speaking on His behalf</em> motivated by fear.
As if the Great One had any need for small humans hastily jumping to His defense!
Of course God loves it when we honor Him and live out a deep reverence towards Him.
But we cannot force others to do so.
And more importantly, doing anything in our lives <a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Romans14%3A23 target=_blank rel=noopener>out of fear instead of trust is effectively sin</a>.</p><p>They say tons of &ldquo;right&rdquo; things — but also out of fear, not out of faith:
Each of them in their own way proclaims God&rsquo;s faithfulness and loyalty towards the ones who stick to Him.
One of them even prophecies that God will reward Job back with double what he lost — and <em>at the end</em> this is even 100 % correct!
But their <strong>hearts</strong> are not right:
They just try to stand on the right side of the argument instead of loving their friend.</p><p>You can say any amount of factually correct things that are objectively right — but if your heart is not right, God will outright object it!
<a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Job42%3A7 target=_blank rel=noopener>In the final chapter of the book</a>, He even goes so far as saying:</p><blockquote><p>I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, <strong>as my servant Job has</strong>!</p></blockquote><p>Ponder this for a moment:
Job&rsquo;s speeches are partially inconsistent, even contradictory about what God does or what God&rsquo;s character is like.
But for God it is Job <strong>in his truthfulness</strong> who speaks <em>the truth</em> instead of his friends who emit <em>true facts</em> <strong>without truthfulness</strong>, without vulnerable honesty.
This is what we clearly see in Psalm 51 where David remarks that God <a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Psalm51%3A6 target=_blank rel=noopener>&ldquo;delights in truth in the inward being&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=its-about-where-god-is-speaking>It&rsquo;s About Where God Is Speaking</h2><p>And then the fourth friend appears: Elihu.
He speaks from a point outside of the spectrum of Job and his friends.
He is not trying to position himself anywhere along the lines of &ldquo;God is always just&rdquo; or &ldquo;Job has never done wrong&rdquo;.
Instead He finds the &ldquo;third way&rdquo; beyond this perspective (which is ultimately a perspective of extreme distance to God):</p><p>He approaches Job <a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Job33%3A6-7 target=_blank rel=noopener>in a resolute yet loving manner</a>.
He talks to both sides about their rights and wrongs.
And he emphasizes the point that this situation (and ultimately, all our lives) is not about who is right or wrong:
It&rsquo;s about <a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/Job33%3A14 target=_blank rel=noopener>God speaking to us</a> through <em>all</em> of life&rsquo;s circumstances and events.</p><p>We see the same pattern in <a class=link href=https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/John9 target=_blank rel=noopener>John 9</a> with Jesus and His disciples when they walk past a man who was born blind:
The disciples ask Jesus:
&ldquo;Who has done wrong that this man is suffering so much, his parents or he himself?&rdquo;
And Jesus rightfully asks:
&ldquo;Wait - how did the idea enter your minds that this situation is about who sinned when and how?
All this trouble is a way for God to glorify Himself!&rdquo;
And then He goes ahead, heals him and &ldquo;the works of God are displayed in him&rdquo;.</p><p>We see that Job&rsquo;s loss, the blindness and poverty of the man at the roadside, and the mess which is our own life are all about God constantly speaking to us, wanting to reach His goal of deep connection with us.
My life is not about myself anymore but about learning to discern where God is working and speaking — and trusting that He is infinitely good.</p><p>Where do you see God speaking in your life?</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/jesus/>jesus</a></section><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under MIT</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
