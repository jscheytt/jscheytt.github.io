I am focussing on this second part verses 10 through 17, and I interpret it in one of the ways I see very much fit: With the groom being both God the Father and God the Son, and the church as His bride.
ESV/NIV Interpretation Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear Zone in on me with all your attention, my daughter Forget your people and your father’s house Leave behind what has given you earthly security by trusting in flesh And the king will desire your beauty I look at you with eyes of love; you are so beautiful and I, your Bridegroom, desire you Since he is your lord, bow to him Surrender yourself to Me completely with your whole life The city of Tyre will come with a gift Then you will gain so much more than what you left behind: You are showered with gifts in My proximity and will no longer live in poverty People of wealth will seek your favour You are no longer the Deserted Wife but the Desired One All glorious is the princess within her chamber To your own joy you discover ever more the beauty with which I made you Her gown is interwoven with gold Even outsiders marvel at your beauty and praise Me for it In embroidered garments she is led to the king I draw you ever closer to Me, your King Her virgin companions follow her – those brought to be with her You will not stay alone in this: You gain real companions who journey towards the King together with you With joy and gladness they are led along In your devotion to Me you experience overflowing joy and rejoicing As they enter the palace of the king Your home is with Me In place of your fathers shall be your sons Your life is made fertile and provides a space for others to grow You will make them princes in all the earth Through the unfolding of My life in yours, your sons and daughters will exercise their responsibility in this world and reign in My Kingdom I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations People in all nations will see this Therefore nations will praise you forever and ever And they will praise the Father, the Son, and the Spirit throughout all eternity "><title>An Interpretation of Psalm 45</title><link rel=canonical href=https://jscheytt.github.io/p/an-interpretation-of-psalm-45/><link rel=stylesheet href=/scss/style.min.8191399262444ab68b72a18c97392f5349be20a1615d77445be51e974c144cff.css><meta property="og:title" content="An Interpretation of Psalm 45"><meta property="og:description" content="Psalm 45 celebrates a royal wedding.
